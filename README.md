Dura Experimental Stage MyWay Firmware.

# Overview

Firmware to run the experimental multi-axis machine tool stage of Nano-team.

### Proposed Workflow
1. **Project Editor** : Visual Studio 2015 (with git support)
2. **Project Compiler** : MyWay PEView 9 (on setup computer)
3. **Project Support** : Matlab AcqTools (lab repository)

### Visual Studio Solution
1. **Sim Project** : Software-In-the-Loop project for control code simulation
2. **Exp Project** : Experimental firmware for embedded system (no PC build)
